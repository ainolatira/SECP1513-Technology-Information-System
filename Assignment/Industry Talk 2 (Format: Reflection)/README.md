## Reflection: University vs. Industry â€“ What Skills Really Matter?

a. What I Gained:

*This topic opened my eyes to the gap between academic training and industry expectations. While university provides a strong theoretical foundation, the industry places higher value on practical problem-solving, teamwork, and project experience.*

b. Suggested Improvement:

*The course could benefit from guest speakers or alumni panels sharing firsthand industry experience to bridge the gap between classroom learning and workplace realities.*

c. Additional Reflection:

*It made me realize the importance of internships and self-driven projects (e.g., GitHub portfolios) to enhance employability and practical relevance.*
