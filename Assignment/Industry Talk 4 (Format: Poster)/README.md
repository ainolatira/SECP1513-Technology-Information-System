# Reflection 4: Generative AI in ICT – Transforming the Future of Innovation

## a. What I Gained:

*This assignment introduced me to the transformative role of Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT, DALL·E, and coding copilots) in revolutionizing industries like design, education, and software development. I now understand how prompt engineering, ethics, and data governance are essential in AI development.*

## b. Suggested Improvement:

*Including a hands-on demo session or a simple AI project (like building a chatbot) would make the learning more interactive and practical.*

## c. Additional Reflection:

*I feel inspired to explore AI further and might consider a specialization or certification in this area. The innovation potential is exciting and highly relevant to future career growth.*
