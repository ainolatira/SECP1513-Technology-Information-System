# Reflections: Design Thinking Project – Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Innovation

## a. What I Gained This Semester:

Through this project, I gained a deep understanding of the Design Thinking methodology—empathy, define, ideate, prototype, and test—and how it applies to real-world innovation. Working on a Big Data and AI-based solution taught me how to approach problems from a user-centered perspective, collaborate in teams, conduct research interviews, and build and refine ideas based on feedback. I also improved my communication, critical thinking, and project management skills through active participation in brainstorming sessions, wireframing, and testing.

## b. Suggested Improvement:

I suggest incorporating more hands-on workshops during each design thinking phase. For example, guided empathy interviews, prototype demo sessions, and real-time feedback simulations could make the experience more engaging and practical. In addition, access to basic prototyping tools (such as Figma, Python notebooks, or AI APIs) from the start would help students bring their ideas to life more efficiently.

## c. Additional Reflection:

This project not only improved my technical and soft skills but also sparked an interest in using AI for solving social or industry problems. I learned that innovation doesn't require complex tools—just the right mindset, teamwork, and a clear focus on users’ needs. I now feel more confident in approaching open-ended challenges and intend to use design thinking in future academic and career-related projects.
